notes


What is the [NEED?] of this tool:
First touch to Expertise
- onboarding - 
- support - 
- education - andragogy / heutagogy

Allows each user to progress as far along the complexity curve as they want. 


- [accessibility] is a huge focus - AI really enables this
  - Universal Design
  - Aggressively Accessible
  - Autogogical - Tool Teaches the Tool

THEMES
- accessibility 
  - onboarding, support
- education
- growth and scaling



Jon post-video:

Technical things
- how will we use AWS services: explain our tech stack and where AWS fits in

- login / authentication (single sign-on?)
    - allows us to keep track of individual users
    - the data also needs to be secure
        - jkl- enhanced by systems that can use their data to build their "profile"


Mentor model:

- model for expertise
    - computer vision, machine learning, clinical biomechanics, animation, video design
- model for assessment of learner
    - gauges their current state
    - gauges their desired state
    - plots the delta (i.e., the curricular bridge)
    
- community data can help enhance all of this


- will also use AWS to host our own local models


Things they're looking for
- high impact
- global impact
- generalizable (easy-- this is ONE APP, we can snap this same type of system onto ANY app)
-- org works on many countries

"work backwards from the end user"
- what they want
- what they need
- what they're bringing to the table


connect everything back to the global mission:
- maximizing accessibility to bleeding-edge 

JKL as project lead, 
- specifically to say he has "ownership" over this part of the global project, 
- allowing Jon to keep in the mocap realm, jkl can focus on the AI integration
