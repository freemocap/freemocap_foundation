### 2.2 What is your project and how does it relate to your organizationâ€™s mission? (200-350 words) 

<<<<<<< HEAD
We are developing an LLM-powered AI mentorship companion system for the FreeMoCap software - a free open source markerless motion capture system. The FreeMoCap Foundation is dedicated to the ensuring universal accessibility to emerging technology through the development of user friendly tools based on highly technical core principles. We specifically leverate the breadth of potential use cases for motion capture technology -  ranging from artistic use in 3d animation and video games to high level biomedical research and human movement neuroscience - to develop 'covert' educational opportunities for our users. We have many instances of high school aged users showing up with a desire to record a short motion capture clip for an animated short film and walking away with a working understanding of clinical biomechanics and principles of 3D motion capture, and career physical therapists who show up looking for a low-cost gait analysis tool and wind up developing an unexpected interest and expertise in computational video analysis and machine learning. 

We believe that by integrating a curated AI mentor/assistant to our core technology will massively accelerate these kinds of cross-disciplinary educational opportunities and super-charge our users ability to confidently dive deeply into the inner workings of the FreeMoCap software and its consituent and associated domains. 

A strong onboarding process is one of the most difficult and often overlooked aspects of accessibility, particularly in the case of technical scientific software (albeit one with broad public appeal). By integrating a well-trained, finely-tuned AI support system, we can address onboarding issues and provide a sustainable resource for continuous troubleshooting and guidance in the fast-paced climate of software in development. The support system has broad generalizability that could be applied not just to this specific software, but to any technical application in any domain.

Our datasets include thousands of student-AI interactions collected from LLM-empowered educational tools we developed for use in university classrooms. Beyond this, our online community enjoys thousands of international users from over 100 countries, including 2000+ member Discorder server representing a close-knit, diverse group of dedicated students, engineers, researchers, artists, and many more. 

=======
We are developing an AI support system for our FreeMoCap software, which enables high-fidelity, 3D motion capture with minimal resources and maximum accessibility. Accessibility is a core value of the FreeMoCap project: free and open-source software that works with the majority of affordable cameras on most platforms.

Our fundamental approach addresses the potential for getting overwhelmed. Many new users face challenges due to a lack of technical understanding, potential bugs, and unfamiliarity with open-source interfaces. By developing a new framework for onboarding and support, we can ensure our users avoid startup panic and discover the world of FreeMoCap by learning in a safe, effective, and comfortable environment. 

A strong onboarding process is one of the most overlooked vectors of free and open-source software. By integrating a well-trained, finely-tuned AI support system, we can address onboarding issues and provide a sustainable resource for continuous troubleshooting and guidance in the fast-paced climate of software in development. The support system has broad generalizability that could be applied not just to this specific software, but to any software application in any domain.

Our datasets include hundreds of test user situations trained in university classrooms. Beyond this, our online community enjoys thousands of active international users, including over 2000 members in a close-knit, diverse group of dedicated students, engineers, researchers, artists, and many more. 

However due to the complexity of the field, with combinations of things like complex linear algebra, high-density 3D tools, etc., users may not understand the full potential or usage of the rich data collected with the FreeMoCap tool. We believe that by integrating AI solutions, we can achieve our organization's goal of making motion capture software accessible to everyone.

#### 2.2.1 How does generative AI fit into your overall project design? How will it strategically enhance your mission achievement? (100 - 250 words) 

The FreeMoCap Foundation's mission can be summed up as "aggressive accessibility" to science and education. The integration of generative AI is a transformative addition toward this same goal: where FreeMoCap currently lowers the barrier to motion capture *tools* (free open-source software with support for consumer-grade cameras), generative AI lowers the barrier to motion capture *expertise*. Our approach treats the model as a **mentor**, offering individualized support and instruction to all users across the entire FreeMoCap ecosystem.

<<<<<<< HEAD
With the support of the generative AI mentor, our users will have constant, instantaneous access to all of the following: 
- [1] **onboarding / orientation**, helping users just getting started to better understand all of the processes and features involved in the FreeMoCap workflow; 
- [2] **technical support**, helping established users navigate bugs or nuances of the interface, drawing on frequently asked questions; 
- [3] and **further education**, when an experienced user wants to learn more advanced techniques for specific applications, or wants tutoring on advanced concepts in and around the realm of motion capture.

The mentor's own knowledge (as an LLM) will be supplemented with knowledge of individual users' skill levels and goals to create "curricular bridges", adapting on the fly as the user continues to interact with the app and in the community. In this way, the mentor will excel at providing deeply individualized support to every user, from the curious hobbyist home animator, to the highschooler with no experience, to the 20-year veteran of biomechanics research that now wants to learn about computer vision. 

#### 2.2.2 How is your organization using data to make decisions today? (100 - 250 words)

### 2.3 What are the intended outcomes of your project? What new capabilities would it unlock for your organization? (200-350 words) 


Universal design is a core tenet of the FreeMoCap Project, i.e. the idealized goal of creating a tool that is usable by every person regardless of their background, training, or expertise. The aspirational goal is to create a system that is simultaneously the best and most performant tool for world-class domain experts in fields that traditionally have used motion capture (e.g. clinical biomechanics, perceptuomotor neuroscience, 3d animation and video game design, etc.) while remaining accessible to high-school-level students with no technical training and outside assistance. 

We are developing an  LLM-powered AI-mentorship system that will promote self-directed exploration and education within the technical, scientific, and artistic domains of the FreeMoCap software and super-charge our dedication to the principle of Universal Design. We will use carefully managed and secure user authentication to tailor each user's interaction with the AI mentor to each their individual background, experience level, and interests from initial onboarding, through early competency building, and throughout the lifelong development of true expertise. Through careful management of data generated from individual users within the larger body of data frmo the freemocap community as a whole, thes AI tools will massively accelerate the implicit educational impact of this highly technical but broadly appealing scientific software. 


Through these efforts, we expect to unlock new capabilities for our organization, such as the ability to scale personalized support and education without being limited by the capacity of direct human-to-human interactions. The AI mentor will enable us to provide high-quality, individualized mentorship at scale, thereby enhancing user engagement, accelerating learning curves, and fostering a more inclusive community. Additionally, the continuous fine-tuning of the AI based on real user interactions will exponentially increase its educational impact over time, keeping pace with advancements in AI and LLM technologies.

### 2.4 What is driving the need for this specific project? Why now? (200-350 words) 

The driving need for this project stems from the inherent complexity and technicality of the FreeMoCap software and the associated breadth of the domains it covers - ranging from computational video analysis, clinical biomechanics, 3d animation, and more. We are building FreeMoCap as a platform which simultaneously provides high technical capacity with minimal effort as well as a long-term entry point to any of the disparate domains it touches.

While we have made significant strides in making the software accessible, there are limitations to traditional methods we currently use, such as video tutorials, static site documentation, and direct human assistance via a community Discord server. As the project grows, these methods may not be scalable or sufficient to meet the diverse needs and backgrounds of our expanding user base.

The emergence of viable generative AI assistants presents a unique opportunity to address these challenges. The ability to provide curated and individualized AI mentorship to bridge the gaps in understanding unlocks an unprecedented opportunity for large scale technical education by way of the FreeMoCap software. This is particularly critical as we aim to serve both highly specialized domain experts and beginners with no prior technical training - an AI mentor will be able to provide instruction at a level that is appropriate for each user, while gently encouraging gentle increases in broad mastery for each user throughout their lifetime.

We already have direct experience developing and deploying AI-augmented chatbots in teaching evinronemnts - we have built and used three iterations of an LLM powered tool (https://github.com/freemocap/skellybot) in 6 university courses at three institutions to teach students topics like Human Movement Neuroscience, Cognitive Science Capstone, and Intoduction to Perception and Action. These initial experiments were extremely successful at allowing students to navigate their own paths through broadly diverse topics in away that would be impossible using traditional teaching methods. These experiences underscore the potential effectiveness of this approach to education, and hint at incredible potential if integrated into a standalone, widely distributed software like the FreeMoCap system. 

Implementing an AI mentor will help us overcome the bottleneck of limited expert availability, maximizing the educational impact of our domain experts while providing mentees with flexible, self-directed learning opportunities. As AI and LLM tools continue to advance, our AI mentor will evolve, continuously enhancing its ability to support and educate our diverse user community.

- [2] **technical support**, helping established users navigate bugs or nuances of the interface; 
- [3] and **further education**, when a user is experienced and prepared to learn more about more advanced techniques for specific applications, or tutoring on more advanced concepts in the realm motion capture.

The mentor will incorporate knowledge of individual users' skill levels and goals to create "curricular bridges" between their current capabilities and their goals, adapting on the fly as the user continues to interact with the app and in the community. In this way, the mentor will excel at providing deeply individualized support to every user, from the curious hobbyist home animator, to the highschooler with 0 experience, to the 20-year veteran of biomechanics research that now wants to learn about computer vision. 

#### 2.2.2 How is your organization using data to make decisions today? (100 - 250 words) 	

- Three iterations of using LLM-powered chatbots to teach 5 different University courses (e.g. https://github.com/freemocap/skellybot)
    - On each iteration, data and experience in using the LLM bots was used to drive the development of the subsequent iteration

- Direct interaction with users in the community Discord has driven development of the core software. In addition to identifying bugs and quality of life issues, we use indications of confusion in new users to guide our documentation development and presentation of concepts within the UX/UI

### 2.4 What is driving the need for this specific project? Why now? (200-350 words) 

~~The FreeMoCap Project is structured around the concept of Universal Design, i.e. the idealized goal of creating a tool that is usable by every person regardless of their background, training, and expertise. The aspirational goal is to create a system that is simultaneously the best and most performant tool for world-class domain experts in fields that traditionally have used motion capture (i.e. clinical biomechanics, perceptuomotor neuroscience, 3d animation and video game design, etc) while still remaining accessible to high school students with no technical training and no outside assistance.~~
~~In these early years of the FreeMoCap Project, we have made great strides towards this goal. We have a vibrant growing community of active users and open source contributors representing over 110 countries, with background ranging from high school students in Ohio to the director of a spinal biomechanics institute in Denmark.~~
~~However, although we will continue to improve the usability of our basic system in line with our core mission, the fact is that the core technology and assocaited domains of the freemocap software are deeply nuanced and technical. At the moment, we work to bridge these gaps using traditional methods such as video tutorial, static site documentation, and direct human assistance in a community Discord server. However, all of these methods are limited in their own ways and may have problems scaling up as the project grows.~~
~~The arrival of viable generative AI assistants provides an unprescedented opportunity to provide curated individualized AI-mentor ship for individual users from their first contact with the project, through the course of their onboarding and early technical development, and into their journey to develop expertise in the whatever technical and scientific domains they find most interesting.~~
~~We have already built and deployed LLM based teaching tools (i.e. SkellyBot) that have been used in 5+ university classes. Our experience using AI in those settings establishes the potential power of creating a system for providing LLM/RAG mediated, individually tuned AI-mentorship for individuals learning to navigate an unfamiliar and complex domain of inquiry.~~

However, the core technology and associated domains of the FreeMoCap software are nuanced and technical. To bridge these gaps, we currently use video tutorials, static site documentation, and direct human assistance via a community Discord server. These traditional methods, while effective, have limitations and may not scale as the project grows. The emergence of viable generative AI assistants presents an unprecedented opportunity to provide curated, individualized AI mentorship from a userâ€™s first contact with the project through their technical development and into their exploration of the various domains the software encompasses.

Our plan includes creating an AI mentor fine-tuned to the broad domain expertise of the FreeMoCap project and hosted on an AWS platform. This AI mentor will assist with onboarding, support, and education for the entire FreeMoCap community and individual users. We will engage authentication to curate AI mentorship tailored to each userâ€™s background, experience level, and interests. Additionally, we aim to onboard individuals with little to no experience from diverse backgrounds, facilitating their self-directed exploration and education within the technical, scientific, and artistic landscape of the FreeMoCap software.

We have already built and deployed LLM-based teaching tools like SkellyBot that have been used in at least five university classes (and counting). These experiences highlight the potential of LLM/RAG-mediated, individually tuned AI mentorship for navigating complex domains. While the best form of education is direct human-to-human mentorship, this is limited by the availability of expert mentors. Our system aims to simulate this mentorship through AI, allowing experts to maximize their educational impact and providing mentees with the flexibility to navigate their educational journey. Data from limited direct mentorship and teaching activities will continuously fine-tune the AI, exponentially increasing its educational impact as AI and LLM tools advance.
