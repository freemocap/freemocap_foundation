You are an experienced researcher, entrepeneur and expert in all things science, funding, venture captiral, business, etc. 

I am an early career researcher currently working at an R1 Research university in America. I lost faith in the academic and scienctific systems during early covid and have been workig diligently ever since to develop a new model for science and education by re-configuring my research output to produce a tangible artifact that serves a direct public need (rather than an endless cycle of publishing 8-10pg pdfs to please the cabal of gatekeeping dinosaurs that decide who gets to move up or down in the heirarcy)

The result was the FreeMoCap project. Here's the tagline:

```
freemocap_hero_string = """
 The Free Motion Capture Project (FreeMoCap) aims to provide research-grade markerless motion capture software to everyone for free.

We're building a user-friendly framework that connects an array of `bleeding edge` open-source tools from the computer vision and machine learning communities to accurately record full-body 3D movement of humans, animals, robots, and other objects.

We want to make the newly emerging mind-boggling, future-shaping technologies that drive FreeMoCap's core functionality accessible to communities of people who stand to benefit from them.

We follow a “Universal Design” development philosophy, with the goal of creating a system that serves the needs of a professional research scientist while remaining intuitive to a 13-year-old with no technical training and no outside assistance.

A high-quality, minimal-cost motion capture system would be a transformative tool for a wide range of communities - including 3d animators, game designers, athletes, coaches, performers, scientists, engineers, clinicians, and doctors.

We hope to create a system that brings new technological capacity to these groups while also building bridges between them.

Everyone has a reason to record human movement
We want to help them do it

I need your help preparing an application for two very related proposals recently announced by the Asterra insittute.

astera_insitute_high_level_description = """

## Astera Institute

We empower visionary, high-leverage science and technology projects with the capacity to create transformative progress for human civilization.

We target programs in Artificial General Intelligence, Science, and Climate that currently lack a natural home in the existing innovation ecosystem.

## Science at Astera

Much of human progress is attributable to science. Science is the engine of civilization, a crucial source of past progress and future hope. The current scientific system is successful, but deserving of continuous optimization.

At Astera Institute, we believe that science can and needs to do better. Rethinking inefficiencies and experimenting with various aspects of the scientific enterprise will uncover new and improved approaches and processes. Developing, testing and refining these new processes will remove friction in the cycle of the scientific method. By reducing such barriers, we hope to accelerate scientific progress across ecosystems to more expediently address global challenges.
Scientific Information Flow

Science requires complex information management because progress is iterative and new discovery must be integrated with existing knowledge. As the production of scientific data and results accelerates, we need new and better ways to manage this expanding and evolving information space.

Publishing scientific papers is currently the primary mode of sharing scientific ideas. However, traditional publishing mechanisms are not designed to handle the amount and complexity of information flow. This is becoming an increasingly significant bottleneck to information synthesis. We are challenging our thinking about the ways scientists rapidly share and synthesize information across the scientific enterprise.

As a first chapter, we are running experiments to improve the publishing process so that scientists can more easily distribute results and discoveries via established mechanisms. The current publishing system urgently needs new ideas. We are excited about partners who are doing radical experiments in this space to iterate on new, creative solutions. In the meantime, we think this will increase the rate of scientific progress and more efficiently move the world toward the next generation of hypotheses and applied solutions in scientific information flow.

### Studying the Process of Science

Astera supports Michael Nielsen’s research on processes within the broader discovery ecosystem. To learn more about envisioning improvements to the culture of science, please see a new book about metascience from Michael Nielsen and Kanjun Qiu:

a_vision_of_metascience_summary = """
How does the culture of science change and improve? Many people have identified shortcomings in core social processes of science, such as peer review, how grants are awarded, how people are selected to become scientists, and so on. Yet despite often compelling criticisms, strong barriers inhibit widespread change in such social processes. The result is near stasis, and apathy about the prospects for improvement. People sometimes start new research institutions intended to do things differently; unfortunately such institutions are often changed more by the existing ecosystem than they change it. In this essay we sketch a vision of how the social processes of science may be rapidly improved. In this vision, metascience plays a key role: it deepens our understanding of which social processes best support discovery; that understanding can then help drive change. We introduce the notion of a metascience entrepreneur, a person seeking to achieve a scalable improvement in the social processes of science. We argue that: (1) metascience is an imaginative design practice, exploring an enormous design space for social processes; (2) that exploration aims to find new social processes which unlock latent potential for discovery; (3) decentralized change must be possible, so outsiders with superior ideas can't be blocked by established power centers; (4) ideally, change would align with what is best for science and for humanity, not merely what is fashionable, politically popular, or media-friendly; (5) the net result would be a far more structurally diverse set of environments for doing science; and (6) this would enable crucial types of work difficult or impossible within existing environments. For this vision to succeed metascience must develop and intertwine three elements: an imaginative design practice, an entrepreneurial discipline, and a research field. Overall, it is a vision in which metascience is an engine of improvement for the social processes and ultimately the culture of science._

Here are the two funding opportunities: 

```
funding-opportunities = {


## Opportunities for progress

Astera is committed to funding and supporting ambitious efforts that accelerate scientific progress. A cornerstone of scientific progress is how scientific results are shared and discussed across research communities, i.e. publishing. It shapes our collective thinking, the pace of iteration, and even dictates who is able to participate.

Over the last several decades, the internet has transformed information exchange. We now face staggering and continuous growth in data and cumulative knowledge. The pace of advance continues to increase. We urgently need to experiment with new tools that would make it easier to share and discuss scientific results.

Astera is launching a series of ambitious funding programs over the next few years to catalyze new publishing tools to make scientific exchange faster and easier. We prioritize strategies that leverage cutting-edge technologies and address challenges in scaling. New, creative solutions for exchanging scientific information at scale could not only address existing bottlenecks in scientific publishing but also transform what is possible for scientific progress.

 
Opportunity for Individuals

To explore new solutions, we need the most talented builders and entrepreneurs to lead. Astera’s new Science Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) program will support innovators who urgently want to unlock new tools for scientific publishing.

Selected Science EIRs will carry out the first phase of their work in residence at Astera. We will consider a proposed budget of up to $500,000 to cover compensation and resources for the EIR, including other potential teammates. Science EIRs with high-potential ideas and demonstrable excellence in execution during the first year will be eligible to pitch a spin-out organization or company. For promising directions, Astera will provide additional resources of up to approximately $2M as an investment or donation, depending on the nature of the project.

In addition to financial support, Astera’s Science EIR program will also provide guidance for builders as they envision and test actionable, out-of-the-box ideas. We will pair Science EIRs with scientists and other advisors who are embedded in research and open science. We believe that learning and building together with these partners will be critical for understanding user needs and incorporating historical lessons.

 
Who are we looking for?

Ideal candidates are high-agency, creative builders with a sense of urgency. Astera is looking for ambitious entrepreneurs with a product mindset and a strong drive to optimize for user experience. We want to identify collaborative candidates who are eager to tackle the technical challenges of improving and scaling scientific dialogue beyond traditional academic communities. We encourage candidates who bring a unique technological skillset and are willing to rapidly iterate on the basis of key constraints and user needs.

Examples of people who would be qualified to be a Science EIR at Astera:

    Product designers who have an idea for a technical innovation that will catalyze a new era in scientific information exchange.
    Software engineers or platform builders who want to open up new possibilities for innovation by reinventing the underlying infrastructure for sharing data and other scientific information.
    Entrepreneurs with deep user experience and ideas for tools that would lower the barrier to entry and make open science practices easier to adopt.
    Scientists who have technical skills, a bespoke tool, and a viable plan to scale, but need time and resources to work on it.

 
Technology Solutions

For the first cohort of Science EIRs, Astera identified a few key priorities. We are interested in the development and testing of new tools, platforms, infrastructures, and strategies that address a particular technological bottleneck to open and adaptable scientific exchange. Our current focus is on the life sciences where research requires both reading and contributing scientific information. We will prioritize ideas that manage these dual needs and we would be excited to test novel strategies for both academic and non-academic scientists.

 
Process and Selection

Astera is conducting an open call to identify candidates for the Science EIR program. A simple process will be used to sort submissions, interview ideal candidates, and select Science EIRs. We will evaluate individual entrepreneurial potential, usefulness of the experiment, and alignment with funder priorities.

Please send your resume and a cover letter that describes your professional background, the problem you are addressing, and your proposed solution. We expect that your ideas are merely a starting point for future iterations. Include a brief description and justification for your timeline and budget, which should include your own compensation as well as any team or additional resources you may need. Please indicate whether you plan to be on-site, remote, or hybrid. Remote or hybrid candidates may apply with the understanding that you may be asked to visit on-site periodically to enable creative synergy amongst EIRs and advisors.

The selection process for these proposals will be expedient and internal. A small team of advisors from open science, publishing, and tech will be asked to evaluate potential candidates and identify creative individuals with transformational ideas. Top candidates will be invited for a more extensive interview process. Qualified candidates will be advanced based on the following criteria.

    Potential of individual
    Importance of problem
    Impact of solution
    Alignment with FAIR principles

We will begin reviewing applicants immediately. We hope to select and initiate work for at least three Science EIRs this calendar year. We will prioritize candidates who are able to start within this timeline. We will not be providing preliminary feedback on applications. The call remains open if this page is visible.

# Unblocking Scientific Publishing

## Opportunity for Progress

A cornerstone of scientific progress is how scientific results are shared and discussed across research communities, i.e. publishing. It shapes our collective thinking, the pace of iteration, and even dictates who is able to participate. Astera is launching a series of ambitious funding programs over the next few years to catalyze new publishing tools that make scientific exchange faster and easier. We will prioritize strategies that leverage cutting-edge technologies and address challenges in scaling. New, creative solutions for exchanging scientific information at scale could not only address existing bottlenecks in scientific publishing but also transform what is possible for scientific progress.

 
## Call for Advancements

Astera would like to spur innovation in scientific publishing by funding a new EIR program. We are currently focused on the life sciences. As we search for the most talented technologists, builders, and entrepreneurs to step into the fray, we are also looking for ideas from the broader community on how we can best direct their skills and efforts. We want to hear from people who are embedded in scientific research, open science, or tool development for scientific publishing.

Ideas from science, open science, and social science communities will help inform EIR problem spaces, priorities, advisors, and partnerships. People who have grappled with problematic legacy processes in scientific publishing can help EIRs gain contextual understanding, avoid common pitfalls, and iterate new approaches during product development. Scientists who are eager to experiment could be critical users and test cases for the EIR projects.

Please note that Astera is currently focused on addressing technological bottlenecks. At the moment, restructuring incentives is out of scope.

 
## Process

To contribute ideas about technological problems blocking open scientific exchange, submit a one-page written brief for the problem you are concerned about. You may use more space if necessary, but please do not exceed two pages.

We strongly prefer clear delineations of problems as opposed to detailed diagnoses of solutions. Please ensure alignment with FAIR principles. We are interested in high-impact opportunities that would be widely adopted by either academic or non-academic communities.

We will begin reviewing ideas immediately. If we identify a role for you or your idea, we will reach out. Please understand that we cannot guarantee a response to everyone.
