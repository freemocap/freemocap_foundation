# Ethics Statement Draft

### Intro:
1. Freemocap aims to empower the creation of high quality recordings of human, animal, and other movements in 3d.
2. It packages existing open source tools and technologies in order to reduce the gap between what is technologically possible and what is accessible to non-experts.
3. It is a core value of freemocap to make our tool accessible to disadvantaged populations so that they can understand new technologies before those technologies are used against them.
4. Freemocap believes that education prevents harm: by making our software easy to understand, we empower users to control the technology rather than be controlled by it.
5. By understanding how a technology works, people are able to protect themselves from nefarious uses of that technology.
6. In considering the potential ethical repurcussions of this tool, we have identified ethical issues possible within the core use of freemocap outlined above, along with ethical issues related to downstream uses of the type of data freemocap creates.

### Within Scope Ethics:
1. Users own the data they generate (who is the user though? Recorder or subject or both?) - they may use their data for any purpose including commercial ones
2. Fxreemocap doesn't own freemocap data, unless it has been donated with explicit consent
3. Is there any special consent required for being a subject of freemocap? (use of freemocap, as the recorder and the subject, should be consensual and not coerced)
4. Bias within algorithms - 1st step acknowledge it, is 2nd step do something about it? (goal of equal performance across skin types, body types, cultural appearances)
5. Commit to keeping software free and open source, and functional with minimal up front hardware cost and no personal info required

### Out of Scope Ethics:
1. Reiterate freemocap thinks potential benefits of the tool outweigh the potential cons
2. Code of conduct/community guidelines style appeal?
3. Not to be used as a means of surveillance
4. Not to be used to stalk or harrass someone
5. We do no believe data from this software can be used to identify "biomarkers," and should not be used as evidence in courts of law
6. In general, freemocap should be used to promote freedom and knowledge, not to control and produce harm.

### Commitments:
1. Be decentralized and community driven
2. Create a governance structure
3. Align with the work of ethical experts, like the Algorithmic Justice League and Free Software Foundation
4. Commit to regular check ins about ethical issues - be transparent about issues that arise and try to address them
